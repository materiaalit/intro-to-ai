	    Robotics
	  </h1>
	  
	  <p>
	    Robotics can be thought of a Grand Challenge in AI: it
	    requires that we address virtually all aspects of AI
	    including
	    <ul>
	      <li> motor control
	      <li> computer vision
	      <li> speech recognition and synthesis
	      <li> natural language processing
	      <li> information retrieval
	      <li> reasoning (logical and probabilistic)
	      <li> search
	      <li> ...
	    </ul>
	    And of course, machine learning, deep learning, and other
	    techniques for developing any of the above are relevant in
	    making better and more general purpose robots.

	  <div class="hint">

	    </div>
	    
	    <div class="hint__body">
	      
	      <p>
		We will not dive deeper into robotics in this course because
		we think that learning robotics actually requires doing
		robotics &mdash; just like learning programming without
		actually doing programming is pointless.
	      </p>
	    </div>
	  </div>
	    
	  <p>
	    Perhaps just to point out a few things that we think are
	    important about robotics: First of all, we already have
	    plenty or robots in everyday use. Our favourite example
	    is the dishwashing machine, of which the first models
	    were invented in around 1850. The dishwashing machine is
	    a robot in the sense that it has sensors that help it
	    sense its real-world environment (the water temperature and its
	    flow, the amount and dirtyness of the dishes, etc.) and
	    actuators that enable it to affect its environment (heating
	    the water, releasing the detergent, sploshing the water, etc.).
	    With this definition, even a radiator thermostat is a robot,
	    which is fine by us!
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Another thing to know about robotics is more difficult
	    to explain in words, and is precisely the reason why we
	    don't even try diving deeper into robotics in this
	    course. Briefly, it's the hardness of operating in the
	    real world. Sensors are never perfect and they
	    malfunction all the time, which makes it really hard to
	    keep track of the state of the system; for instance, the
	    relative location of the robot and the objects around
	    it. Likewise, the actuators such as motors that help the
	    robot move itself around, are imperfect so that whenever
	    the robots may try to move its hand or roll forward on its
	    wheels exactly 10 cm, it would in reality end up moving
	    9 or 11 cm.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    The latter issue implies that developing robust robotics
	    solutions often requires a whole another level, often a
	    "lower level" in some sense, than developing other kinds
	    of AI applications that only have to deal with simulated
	    environments or static data, not the messy real world.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    If you have a chance to try robotics, we encourage you to
	    do it. We used to do robotics in the course in the
	    previous editions, using LEGO Mindstorms robots, but the
	    robots we have in stock are becoming technically so
	    outdated that programming them is a real pain in the
	    butt. The latest LEGO models also don't seem to support
	    sensible Python or even Java coding. (Let us know if you
	    know
	    better.) <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry
	    PI</a> looks like a promising alternative. In case you'll
	    have a chance to try any of these and build and program
	    robots, You'll hopefully understand what we're trying to say
	    in the above!

	    Ethics of AI
	  </h1>
	  
	  <p>
	    <b>This section is still under construction</b>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Our last main topic on this course is the Ethics of AI.
	    Just to get one thing off our chest, we must emphasize
	    that this is indeed "last but not least"; in other
	    words, the reason why ethics is discussed as the last
	    topic, is by no means that it would be somehow a less
	    fundamental, nice-to-know topic. This may have been what
	    people &mdash; including us &mdash; thought years ago, but
	    as the impact of AI in the society is becoming more and
	    more prominent, ethical concerns about this impact are also
	    being brought to the surface.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    On a related note, the fact that the very material you are
	    now reading is work in progress, reflects the fact that
	    the field is very much in motion as more and more people
	    are talking about it.

	      <p>
		One thing that seems to happen repeatedly is that AI
		people or other technologists arrive at the scene,
		encounter a problem, and think they must be the first
		to ever have thought about it. This tends to lead to
		awkward situations where the work by other people, who
		may have been studying the same issues, sometimes for
		decades, are ignored.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		When you deal with ethical issues related to
		technology, you should make an effort to look for
		earlier work on the topic. It may be difficult, since
		people may have used different terminology. Keep an
		eye out in particular for work in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies">Science and Technology Studies (STS)</a> field.

	  <h2 class="material-heading">
	    Ethical AI or Ethics of AI?
	  </h2>

	  <p>
	    There are actually several topics where AI and ethics meet.
	    For instance, there is a topic called <b>machine ethics</b>,
	    which is focused on building computational systems that
	    behave in ethical ways. You have perhaps heard about
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">
	      the Three Laws of Robotics</a> (from the sci-fi author
	    Isaac Asimov's 1942 short story Runaround).</p>

	  <p>
	    Machine ethics is a legitimate scientific field. However, it is
	    somewhat disconnected from existing AI systems and their
	    societal impact, because as you've probably noticed by now,
	    modern AI systems don't operate on a level where rules like
	    <i>"A robot may not injure a human being or, through
	      inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."</i> (the
	    First Law of Robotics, according to Asimov).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    What we will discuss in this part of the course, is therefore
	    not machine ethics, but the ethics of AI, by which we mean
	    the much broader viewpoint into the societal and ethical
	    issues related to the use of AI systems. This entails that
	    we shift focus from the technical aspects of the AI systems
	    to the socio-technical entity that involves the humans involved
	    and affected by the use of such systems.
	  </p>

	  <div class="hint">
	    <div class="hint__header">
	      <i class="fa fa-info-circle hint__icon"></i>A Note of the Scope of AI Regulation
	    </div>
	    
	    <div class="hint__body">
	      
	      <p>
		As we've discussed, there is no commonly agreed
		definition of AI. Therefore, any regulation that tries to
		govern the use of AI will be somewhat hard to define in
		an unambiguous way. In fact, it is our personal opinion
		that AI <i>shouldn't</i> be regulated as such, but that
		it should be regulated just like any technology (or in
		many cases, not even as technology, but as human
		activity). Why would it make a difference, from a legal
		point of view, whether something is done by using AI or
		without AI? We can't think of a single case, where the
		use of AI should make something legal or illegal.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		However, since the deployment of AI systems amplifies
		some potential harms to people &mdash; e.g., mass
		surveillance, deanonymization, loss of accountability,
		complicated authorship questions &mdash; various
		regulatory stakeholders, most notably the European
		Union, have decided to create AI regulation. This will
		unavoidably lead to more work for lawyers figuring out
		when the AI regulation applies and when not, and how
		it will be consolidated with existing sector-specific
		regulation. But that's what lawyers do...
