	    Robotics
	  </h1>
	  
	  <p>
	    Robotics can be thought of a Grand Challenge in AI: it
	    requires that we address virtually all aspects of AI
	    including
	    <ul>
	      <li> motor control
	      <li> computer vision
	      <li> speech recognition and synthesis
	      <li> natural language processing
	      <li> information retrieval
	      <li> reasoning (logical and probabilistic)
	      <li> search
	      <li> ...
	    </ul>
	    And of course, machine learning, deep learning, and other
	    techniques for developing any of the above are relevant in
	    making better and more general purpose robots.

	  <div class="hint">

	    <div class="hint__body">
	      
	      <p>
		We will not dive deeper into robotics in this course because
		we think that learning robotics actually requires doing
		robotics &mdash; just like learning programming without
		actually doing programming is pointless.
	      </p>
	    </div>
	  </div>
	    
	  <p>
	    Perhaps just to point out a few things that we think are
	    important about robotics: First of all, we already have
	    plenty or robots in everyday use. Our favourite example
	    is the dishwashing machine, of which the first models
	    were invented in around 1850. The dishwashing machine is
	    a robot in the sense that it has sensors that help it
	    sense its real-world environment (the water temperature and its
	    flow, the amount and dirtyness of the dishes, etc.) and
	    actuators that enable it to affect its environment (heating
	    the water, releasing the detergent, sploshing the water, etc.).
	    With this definition, even a radiator thermostat is a robot,
	    which is fine by us!
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Another thing to know about robotics is more difficult to
	    explain in words, and is precisely the reason why we don't
	    even try diving deeper into robotics in this
	    course. Briefly, it's the hardness of operating in the
	    real world. Sensors are never perfect and they malfunction
	    all the time, which makes it really hard to keep track of
	    the state of the system; for instance, the relative
	    location of the robot and the objects around it. Likewise,
	    the actuators such as motors that help the robot move
	    itself around, are imperfect so that whenever the poor
	    robot may try to move its hand or roll forward on its
	    wheels exactly 10 cm, it would in reality end up moving 9
	    or 11 cm.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    The latter issue implies that developing robust robotics
	    solutions often requires operating on a whole another
	    level, often on a "lower level" in some sense, than
	    developing other kinds of AI applications that only have
	    to deal with simulated environments or static data, not
	    the messy real world.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    If you have a chance to try working with actual robots, we
	    encourage you to do it. We used to do robotics in the
	    course in the previous editions, using LEGO Mindstorms
	    robots, but the robots we have in stock are becoming
	    technically so outdated that programming them is a real
	    pain in the butt. The latest LEGO models also don't seem
	    to support sensible Python or even Java coding. (Let us
	    know if you know
	    better.) <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry
	    PI</a> looks like a promising alternative. In case you'll
	    have a chance to try any of these and build and program
	    robots, you'll hopefully understand what we're trying to
	    say here!
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    With that, let's move on to the last major topic on the course.
	  </p>
	  
	  
	  <h1 class="material-heading">
	    Ethics of AI
	  </h1>
	  
	  <p>
	    <b>This section is still under construction</b>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Our last main topic on this course is the Ethics of AI.
	    Just to get one thing off our chest, we must emphasize
	    that this is indeed "last but not least"; in other words,
	    the reason why ethics is discussed as the last topic, is
	    by no means that it would be somehow a less fundamental,
	    nice-to-know topic. This may have been what people &mdash;
	    to be honest, even us &mdash; thought years ago, but as
	    the impact of AI in the society is becoming more and more
	    prominent, ethical concerns are also being brought to the
	    surface.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    On a related note, the fact that the very material you are
	    now reading is work in progress, reflects the fact that
	    the field is very much in motion as more and more people
	    are talking about it.

		One thing that seems to happen repeatedly is that AI
		people or other technologists arrive at the scene,
		encounter a problem, and think they must be the first
		to ever have thought about it. This tends to lead to
		awkward situations where the work by other people, who
		may have been studying the same issues, sometimes for
		decades, are ignored.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		When you deal with ethical issues related to
		technology, you should make an effort to look for
		earlier work on the topic. It may be difficult, since
		people may have used different terminology, but it's
		definitely worth at least trying. You're unlikely to be
		the first to come across the issue. Keep an
		eye out in particular for work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies">Science and Technology Studies (STS)</a>.

	    </div>
	  </div>
	  
	  <h2 class="material-heading">
	    Ethical AI or Ethics of AI?
	  </h2>

	  <p>
	    There are actually several ways in which AI and ethics meet.
	    For instance, there is a topic called <b>machine ethics</b>,
	    which is focused on building computational systems that
	    behave in ethical ways or that have, in a very literal sense,
	    a moral code. You have perhaps heard about
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">
	      the Three Laws of Robotics</a> from the sci-fi author
	    Isaac Asimov's 1942 short story Runaround. Machine ethics
	    focuses on this type of rules that could in principle
	    encoded into AI systems.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Machine ethics is a legitimate scientific field. However,
	    it is disconnected from existing AI systems and their
	    societal impact, because as you've probably noticed by
	    now, modern AI systems don't operate on a level where
	    rules like
	    <i>"A robot may not injure a human being or, through
	      inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"</i>,
	      which is the First Law of Robotics according to Asimov.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    What we will discuss in this part of the course is therefore
	    <i>not</i> machine ethics, but the <b>ethics of AI</b>, by
	    which we mean the broader viewpoint into the societal and
	    ethical issues related to the use of AI systems. This
	    entails that we shift focus from the technical aspects of
	    the AI systems themselves to the entire socio-technical
	    context that involves not only the AI system(s) but also
	    the humans that are involved and affected by the use of
	    such systems.
	  </p>

	  <div class="hint">
	    <div class="hint__header">
	      <i class="fa fa-info-circle hint__icon"></i>A Note of the Scope of AI Regulation
	    </div>
	    
	    <div class="hint__body">
	      
	      <p>
		As we've discussed, there is no commonly agreed
		definition of AI. Therefore, any regulation that tries
		to govern the use of AI will be somewhat hard to
		define in an unambiguous way. In fact, it is our
		personal opinion that AI <i>shouldn't</i> be regulated
		as such, but that it should be regulated along with
		any other technology, or in many cases, not even as
		technology, but as human activity.</p>

	      <p>
		Why would it make a difference, from an ethical or
		legal point of view, whether something is done using
		AI or without AI? We can't think of a single case,
		where the use of AI should make something legal or
		illegal. Any law that that depends on whether
		something is AI or not is prone to finding loopholes
		in the assumed definition of AI.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		However, since the deployment of AI systems amplifies
		some potential harms to people &mdash; mass
		surveillance, deanonymization, loss of accountability,
		complicated authorship questions, to name a few
		&mdash; various regulatory stakeholders, most notably
		the European Union, have decided to create AI
		regulation. So the milk is most likely already
		spilled. This will unavoidably lead to more work for
		lawyers figuring out when the AI regulation applies
		and when not, and how it will be consolidated with
		existing sector-specific regulation. But that's what
		lawyers do... &#129335;

		  Ethics can be thought of not only a set of standards
		  of right and wrong, but also as the process by which
		  such standard can be deliberated and refined, usually
		  through dialogue between the stakeholders. (<a href="https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/">Read more here</a>.)
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  So let's "do ethics"!
		</p>

		<p>
		  Choose one of the following talking points:
		  <ol>
		    <li> AI-generated art is currently a hot topic
		      with systems like DALL-E, Imagen, and Stable
		      Diffusion being used to create amazign
		      artwork. Who (or what) should be entitled to
		      intellectual property rights in these cases?
		    <li> The real-world impact of AI is growing all
		      the time. <!--Social media filter algorithms have a
		      decicise effect on what kinds of bubbles we live
		      in, automatic decision making systems determine
		      who gets a credit card and screen job
		      applications, etc.--> Until recently, AI
		      researchers were mostly oblivious to such issues
		      and weren't really expected to consider the societal
		      implications of their work.  Nowadays, some AI
		      conferences (most prominently
		      the <a href="https://nips.cc/">NeurIPS</a>
		      conference, see <a href="a
		      href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01705">this
		      study</a>), require a broader impact statement
		      or a checklist that asks the authors of
		      submitted research articles to have a think
		      about the impact of their work. Some argue that
		      this is a path towards censorship and political
		      ideology to mess up with the academic freedom.
		      Others argue that science can no longer pretend
		      to be separate from the real world.
		  </ol>
		</p>

		<p>
		  Your task is to have a debate about the topic of
		  your choice (from the above two alternatives).
		  You can have the debate with yourself, pretending
		  to take two opposing views on the topic. Even better,
		  you can ask your fellow student or someone else to
		  assume the opponent's role.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Document your dialogue by summarizing at least ten
		  (10) arguments and counter-arguments in an
		  alternating order like
		  <dl>
		    <dt>You</dt> <dd>I think X</dd>
		    <dt>Your Opponent</dt> <dd>No, X is wrong because Y</dd>
		    <dt>You</dt> <dd>That may be, but even so, there's Z...</dd>
		  </dl>
		  (So both you and your opponent get to make at least
		  five points. And no, "you're a f**king idiot"
		  does <b>not</b> count as an argument!)
		</p>

		<p>
		  <i>Hint:</i> Remember to remain polite and respectful.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <i>Hint 2:</i> In case you don't have an opponent
		  at hand, there's nothing wrong with trying social
		  media like Twitter... Just remember the first hint.
		</p>
