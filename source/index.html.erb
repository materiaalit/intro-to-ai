  Introduction to AI
<% end %>

<p>
Welcome to the Introduction to AI! This the Fall 2019 edition of the
course at the Department of Computer Science, University of
Helsinki. The course is an intermediate level 5 credit course, which
is organized by
the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/programmes/master/data-science">Data
Science MSc programme</a>. We also welcome students in the
<a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/fi/ohjelmat/kandi/tietojenkasittelytieteen-kandiohjelma">Computer
Science BSc programme</a> as well as all other students as a part of
your minor subject studies.
</p>

<p>
The calculated workload of a 5 cu course is 18 hours per week, so
please be prepared to spend time and effort in learning. The course
will require hard work. You have been warned.

  Working methods
<% end %>

<p>
  The course includes lectures (2 x 2h per week) and exercise sessions (2h
  per week). The exercise sessions are meant for discussing the problems
  after you have completed them by yourself.
</p>

<p>
  The lectures are not compulsory but they are meant to be useful.
</p>

<p>
  Exercise points are marked in the exercise sessions; see <i>Grading</i>
  below.
</p>

<p>
  You must register in one of the exercise groups on the registration
  system. If all the groups are full, please register in the overflow
  group and contact the lecturer or the TAs for instructions.
</p>

<p>
  In case you have an unexpected constraint and can't make it to your
  own exercise session, the following options are (prioritized):
  <i>(a)</i> ask for permission to go to another group; or <i>(b)</i>
  submit your solutions by email before your own group session AND
  explain the unexpected situation (NB: being busy at work
  is <i>not</i> a valid excuse). You can only use the
  option <i>b</i> two (2) times during the course to gain points.
</p>

<% partial 'partials/material_sub_heading' do %>
  Course material
<% end %>

<p>
  There is no course textbook. The course material consists of lecture
  slides and other material collected here.  You can find the lecture
  slides and other useful information on
  the <a href="https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/data15001/129802916">course
  homepage</a>. The lecture slides are found under Material.
</p>

<p>
  But please continue reading this page first.
</p>

<% partial 'partials/material_sub_heading' do %>
  Support
<% end %>

<p>
  Questions and answers are most easily discussed on 
  <a href="https://t.me/IAI19">the course telegram channel</a>.
  The lecturer and the TAs will do their best to  answer questions 
  but other students are also encouraged to engage in the discussion &ndash; 
  often the best explanation is provided by a fellow student rather than a professor!
</p>

<p>
  Please maintain a positive and supporting attitude in all discussions.
  There are no stupid questions, and making a mistake is often an
  excellent opportunity to learn &ndash; also for others.
</p>

<% partial 'partials/material_sub_heading' do %>
  Grading
<% end %>


<p>
  Grading on a scale 1–5. Grading depends on the completed exercises (about 33% of the grade) and the course exam (about 67% of the grade). You get full exercise points for completing 80% of the exercises.
</p>


<% partial 'partials/material_heading' do %>
  Accounts and tools
<% end %>



<% partial 'partials/material_sub_heading' do %>
  Creating a user account
<% end %>

<p>
  You'll need a user account to the Test My Code (TMC) system that will be used to automatically assess some parts of the programming exercises.
  You should also log in to the course material with the same account.
</p>

<p>
  You can enter your student number as "Organizational identifier"
  (found in TMC settings after login) for future purposes, but on this 
  course the exercises points are not collected directly from TMC.
  If you don't have an account already, you can create one
  here: <a href="https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new" target="_blank"
  rel="noopener">https://tmc.mooc.fi/user/new</a>.
</p>

<% partial 'partials/material_sub_heading' do %>
  Installing the programming environment
<% end %>

<p>
  We recommend that you use the Netbeans IDE with the TMC plugin. The plugin makes it easy to return the exercises. These tools are installed in computer labs B221 and BK107 under the name 'TMCBeans'.
</p>

<p>
  If you're doing the course on your own computer you'll need to install the Java JDK 8 and and the NetBeans with TMC-environment.
</p>


<ul>

  <li>
    <strong>Installing Java (* linux, check below!)</strong>: install JDK (Java SE Development Kit 8u144) from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Installing NetBeans with TMC</strong>: Go to <a href="http://update.testmycode.net/installers/tmc-netbeans_hy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://update.testmycode.net/installers/tmc-netbeans_hy/</a>. Choose the right installer for your operating system (eg. for windows .exe, for linux .sh and for macOS .tgz) Once you have downloaded the installer, install the program.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
  <strong>(*)</strong> If you're on linux installing openjdk is probably easier. If you're on Ubuntu you can install it with:
</p>

<pre>
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
</pre>

<p>
If you want to do the exercises in Python instead you can download project templates with <a href="https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-cli/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tmc-cli</a> or straight from <a href="https://tmc.mooc.fi/org/hy/courses/535">TMC</a>. TMC also gives you an option to submit full completed exercise folders as a zip files. To run tests locally use the following command: <code>python3 -m tmc</code> 
<b>Note:</b> TMC tests require Python 3.  
</p>

<p>
  Next select the right course in the programming environment.
</p>



<% partial 'partials/material_sub_sub_heading' do %>
  Selecting the right course in the programming environment
<% end %>

<p>
Open the tmc settings and make sure that the server address is: <code>https://tmc.mooc.fi/org/hy</code>. Then log in and select <code>hy-intro-to-ai-19</code> as your course.
</p>

<p>
If you're using Python and tmc-cli, select <code>hy-intro-to-ai-19-python</code> as your course.
